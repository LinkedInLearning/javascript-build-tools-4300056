# COURSENAME

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `JavaScript Build Tools`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Instructions

This repository has dedicated folders for the build tool examples in the course:

- The "example-parcel," "example-rollup," "example-vite," and "example-webpack" folders contain completed code examples of the same React project using four different build tools.
- The "demo-vite" folder is used in chapter 2 for hands-on practice in setting up Vite in a project.
- The "no-build" folder contains the React project without any build tool configuration. This folder is provided for you to experiment setting up your own build tool or testing build tools not covered in the course.

## Installing

The demos in this course are configured to run in GitHub Codespaces and can also be run on your local machine.
Each example folder has its own set of npm dependencies defined in `package.json`. To run the examples:

1. Use Terminal to navigate to the example folder, ie `cd example-vite`.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run the example using scripts defined in `package.json`, ie `npm run dev`.
